<h1 class="title">On the Eternity of Spiritual Gifts, and the Holy Spirit</h1>
<p class="author">Elliot Lake</p>

<p>The Psalm for today (26th September 2021) had a particular verse which really struck me. From the Douay Rheims <span class="math inline">:</span> <em>The fear of the Lord is holy, enduring for ever and ever: the judgments of the Lord are true, justified in themselves.</em> On it’s own, the Fear of the Lord enduring forever may not strike us as something which articulates our direct relationship with God, but when we consider this in the light of other scripture, something amazing comes about. Consider Isaiah 11<span class="math inline">:</span>1-3 <span class="math inline">:</span> <em>And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up out of his root. And the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: the spirit of wisdom, and of understanding, the spirit of counsel, and of fortitude, the spirit of knowledge, and of godliness.And he shall be filled with the spirit of the fear of the Lord. He shall not judge according to the sight of the eyes, nor reprove according to the hearing of the ears.</em> So, the rod from the root of Jesse (Jesus Christ) has a spirit of the Fear of The Lord rest upon him. An eternal spirit. This eternity must mean that this spirit is in some way of God, because created things all have a beginning. Also, to be holy, it must be of God too, because only God is holy. Therefore, for the spirit of the Fear of the Lord to rest on a person (and it does, even beyond Christ, if one reads Proverbs), then something uncreated and holy rests on a person. We know from Natural Theology that nothing can exist with God in eternity besides God, because for this to happen, it would have to be the principle of its own existence. If there were two principles of existence, this would invoke a contradiction because there is no distinction in existence at all, in the exact same way when considering the truth of any statement, it is either true or false when considered as a whole, and not varying degrees (This is not to suggest that a statement cannot have aspects which are false mingled with the true, but if we do this, the single falsehood renders the whole statement false). Therefore, this Spirit of the Fear of the Lord IS God. Now, we can say that this is a gift of the Holy Spirit (Which it is), but what I want to say is more important is that, by receiving these spirits, we are actually participating in the Divine. God, despite being infinitely transcendent and without error or sin or anything less than pure truth and being, is yet also actually extremely intimate with us. Beyond holding us in existence (Hebrews 1<span class="math inline">:</span>3), he also sends us spirits which perfect us in the virtues. He doesn’t simply set you up with your own powers and leave you to it, he actively roots for people when he sends them certain spirits, such as the Fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wisdom. From this, we can not only see that God is intimate with us and actively loves us, we can see he is also infinitely good, and we should never ever despair of God’s distance from us, either in our existence of (analogously) so far as how he feels about us.</p>
