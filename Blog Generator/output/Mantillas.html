<p>I am sure that a lot of trads, particularly women, love this headgear that women tend to wear at mass. Some will even go as far as to say that these are things which add to a woman’s modesty. However, I think they are a disgusting abomination and should be disposed of, especially out of the hands of young women precisely because they aren’t modest. Modesty is the regulation of human exterior actions in line with the rule of humility, which is fundamentally behaving in a manner which is not ostentatious. It is being willing to blend in, as Christ blended in for 30 years of his earthly life, living and working with very little to set him apart from any other Judean. It is not trying to look a particular look for social points, or trying to excite the passions of a man. The fact of the matter is that the mantilla, especially in this year, that I think it’s very very hard to avoid these things. First of all, it’s extremely frilly and lacy, and especially now nobody veils, it makes a woman stand out. This is added to since now very few women cover their hair, let alone among the young. It attracts attention from the opposite sex, and it can be an expression of ostentation as it associates a woman with a certain movement. This ostentation is contrary directly to modesty, and therefore this should be avoided when it’s worn on any of these accounts. As I think it’s very hard to avoid for young women, I think it would be good if the bishops had an interdict on them for young women. If women wish to cover their hair at mass, as is the tradition, let them wear a piece of thick and opaque cloth, in the same manner as many nuns do. It is a lot less ostentatious than a mantilla, doesn’t have the political associations and is less likely to gain the attention of men. Of course, like anything, it can be worn out of pride, but I think it’s less so. I can also hear the cries of some "You’re only concerned because you are unchaste, why don’t you stick to your own lane". Well, it’s very hard to practice chastity in the presence of many women who are either advertently or inadvertently provoking male attention. One of the things that happens when a man lays aside all of the concupisence of the flesh for a few months notices is how easy it is to fall on this account. St Alphonsus Ligori even prohibited intergender touching without a good reason because of how it leads to carnal pleasure that could lead to mortal sin. Blessed Seraphim of Sarov even instructs his monks to avoid female contact on this account. He quotes St Isidore of Pelusium who says <span class="math inline">:</span> <em>If there are some conversations that corrupt good habits, then they are the ones that are conducted with women, even if these be quite decent, because they can secretly corrupt the inward man by means of bad thoughts; and even though the body be clean, the soul nevertheless will be defiled. Is there anything more solid than a rock? Or, thin, what is softer than water or drops of water? Nevertheless, the unceasing action of one element overpowers the other. Thus, if one almost unconquerable substance can be conquered by something which is nothing in comparison with it, and it suffers and is distracted, then can it be that the easily wavering human will, from the continuousness of the action, will not be defeated or corrupted?</em> In other words, touching in many cases is near occasion. Is it not the same with our sight? Do these people seem to think that men are St Anthony of the Desert, who literally fought demons who sought to kill him physically that he may control his passions. I think that people who are so inconsiderate as to not recall man’s weakness as to oppose on this account should keep quiet and forget this opposition. If a Desert Father needs to spend decades disciplining this passion, how can you expect laymen to all of a sudden forget the fall? It is so much nonsense to pretend that men and women can just dress how they like. In essence, for the sake not only of men, but for proper modesty, I believe that women, especially young women, ought to stop wearing this headgear. I think rather that women should embrace a true modesty, which doesn’t necessary consist in wearing veils or in dresses, but in sensible clothes and in the practice of humility.</p>
