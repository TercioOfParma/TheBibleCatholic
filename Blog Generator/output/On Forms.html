<h1 class="title">On Essential Forms and Substance Physicalism</h1>
<p class="author">Elliot Lake</p>
</header>
<p>In the modern world, the default view of reality is that all things are of matter. This matter is a physical "stuff" which composes all things, from the very smallest atom to the very largest building. There is nothing outside of it which is, and this is eternal. This matter contains various aspects, such as occasionally having rationality in the case of mankind, but also other aspects dependent on the various elements. However, as I am going to attempt to show here, this physicalistic reductionism is all together false.<br /><br />
In the first place, it is false when it comes to human rationality. Human thought patterns are univocal in their content (I.E. they have a singular sense when cogitated on, in other words we know precisely what we are thinking when we think in a directed manner). Physical things are open to interpretation always, and never have a singular necessary sense in themselves consequently. If this were the case, there would be no need to interpret or translate written materials, even though these are physical manifestations of formal thought processes. Thus, human thought patterns are non physical, and are therefore not composed of matter in the way in which the modern average person thinks of matter. A person may point out that the human mind is, however, influenced by physical things. We observe this when brain damage is sustained in some manner. Of course, the mind is reliant at this time on the feedback of the body. They may ask how, therefore, since the mind is non physical, how it can be that the mind receives information from the body. The answer is that matter isn’t actually a substance to say that "it’s touching" as this question takes as an implicit premise of interaction is a false assumption. The law of identity doesn’t need to "touch" anything to be true and to be a fundamental basis of reality, because it is non physical. Why would the human mind need to "touch" the physical brain matter to interact with it? The alternative view would be to realise that actualisation of something doesn’t require contact by any means. For more information on this, please read James Ross’ Paper on the Immaterial Aspects of Thought.<br /><br />
In the second place, it doesn’t make sense of elements as described on the periodic table. For instance, suppose I take an Iron atom, take a picture of it, and then divide it into various pieces. I may be able to perceive the various sub atomic particles, but based on one of those pictures alone, I couldn’t determine it was iron, for it wouldn’t have the pre-requisite content. However, it nonetheless is an Iron Atom. Hence, the "form" of the Iron Atom must not be contained in the subatomic particles which substantiate it, and therefore there must be a non physical aspect to each and every atom, as a physicalistic view would suggest that the atom is only its parts.<br /><br />
Further on this point, let us observe another problem in relation to atoms, and that is that each of these atoms have entirely and often wildly different properties despite being made up of the same constituent parts, which would be subatomic particles. However, if there is the same input, and the only difference is quantity, which do we get sometimes wildly different output? A person would correctly observe that many of these aspects are as a result of the interaction between the particles and by exterior forces, but this is only to kick the tin can further down the path so to speak, as all of these fundamental forces originate in the same matter. If all is matter, how is that matter in some places has some actual force and in others it doesn’t if there is nothing else to somehow limit the powers of that matter? We cannot divide down something so it is half matter, as this would still be of matter, and hence have the same problem. An alternative view would be to hold that the non physical form is what determines the function of the object which is individuated by the matter, therefore moving the locus of the properties of a certain element to its essential form rather than the matter which composes it.<br /><br />
