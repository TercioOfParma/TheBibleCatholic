<h1 class="title">On the Hellenistic Influence on Second Temple Judaism and Early Rabbinical Judaism</h1>
<p class="author">Elliot Lake</p>
</header>
<p>It has come to my attention, from the review of one Jewish person on a book refuting rabbinical objections to Christianity, that there is this strange view among some contemporary Jews that Christianity is some sort of weird gentile mashup of Second Temple Judaism with the surrounding culture, and hence Christ is illegitimate due to that influence. They will point to the fact that the New Testament has citations in it from the Septuagint (Henceforth LXX, as this means the Seventy) as opposed to the Masoretic Hebrew which they are used to. Further, the person in question even went so far as to assert that we do not know who composed the LXX. As these questions can be briefly answered and illustrated here, I will do so. This, being my blog and a part of my daily writing practice, will not be of the level of detail of an academic publication. This is articulate some evidence of the very large amount of interaction between the Judaism of the time of Christ and the Hellenistic culture which ruled over them for a few centuries and persisted under the Romans.</p>
<h1 id="the-authors-of-the-lxx">The authors of the LXX?</h1>
<p>There are some who seem to be unaware or pretend that we don’t know who composed the LXX. However, we have attestation of who composed it in a way which is basically contemporary with the non torah aspects of the LXX, which was written in the 2nd Century BC (The Torah being translated in the 3rd Century BC). <em>The Letter of Aristeas</em> presents a rather tantilising account of its composition, speaking of the Rabbis who translated the Old Testament books miraculously translating each book in the same way as others. This was written in the 1st Century BC, and attests to a Pre Christian account of the LXX being in someway inspired. In Christian circles, the divinely inspired nature of these works is still debated for reasons besides this letter (According to the Jerome Biblical Commentary, which I DO NOT recommend). However, the likes of St Jerome and others point out that this specific work is likely legendary. Nonetheless, as with all legendary accounts (Second Temple Judaism is replete with these sorts of accounts, such as the Apocalypse of Baruch and 1 Enoch), these are not invented whole cloth out of nothing, there must be fire for there to be smoke.<br /><br />
</p>
<h1 id="other-versions-of-the-tanakh-in-greek">Other versions of the TaNaKh in Greek?</h1>
<p>On top of the LXX, which is the oldest attestation of the TaNaKh which we have, even post Christ we have instances of translations to Greek of the TaNaKh. For instance, St Jerome, in his critical Latin edition of some of the scriptures, made use of Aquila and Symmachus, both who translated the scriptures from Hebrew into Greek after Christ. As at this point there was a widespread Jewish community across the Roman Empire, and the language of commerce and high culture was always Greek, especially in large eastern Jewish centres like Alexandria, this makes sense. How does one spread the message of God without being understood?</p>
<h1 id="jewish-interactions-with-hellenistic-culture">Jewish Interactions with Hellenistic Culture</h1>
<p>Not only did the scriptures make their way into Greek, there was a large amount of interaction and responses to Hellenistic culture from Jewish authors. The divinely inspired Book of Wisdom and Wisdom of Ben Sira are especially pointed in this regard, with the former responding to the idolatry, mystery cults and hedonism which permeated Greek culture and the latter providing advice to young men for negotiating the Hellenistic upper classes. An interesting and often overlooked fact is that, despite the solidification of the Jewish canon theoretically had happened by the 3rd Century, you still have Rabbis such as Ben Mari asserting the Divine Inspiration of Ben Sira into the 5th Century AD.<br /><br />
Additionally, you have the tremendously important works of Flavius Josephus, who wrote his works in Aramaic and in Greek, the latter to engage with the Gentiles. The Aramaic version even has a measured Testimony to the same Christ, which was discovered by Schlomo Pines, while the Greek version has the same passage which is often asserted to be a later interpolation of his work. All three of Josephus’ works (Antiquities, The Jewish War and Against Apion) were all written in the late 1st Century AD. The final work was even a rebuke of the Gentile Historians on their representation of historical fact.<br /><br />
Thirdly, you have the giant of Second Temple theology <span class="math inline">:</span> Philo of Alexandria. Known for his very interesting views on God’s persons, which is closer to a Christian understanding rather than a Post Maimonides view, he wrote a huge number of works pertaining to the Sacred Scriptures in Greek. He was also highly respected by the Second Temple Jewish Community, being sent to Rome to Caligula to protect the community in the wake of riots that Jews partook in due to the forcible installation of idols in their synagogues by the governor Flaccus.<br /><br />
On top of this, even after Christ you have the engagement of Rabbis with Hellenised Jews. For instance, Rabbi Akiva is known for his instruction of the Jews of Alexandria, which even resulted in a disciple called Hanan the Egyptian.<br /><br />
</p>
<h1 id="where-do-the-gospels-fit-into-this-picture">Where do the Gospels fit into this picture?</h1>
<p>As I have illustrated, regardless of what opinions we may have about the veracity of each source, that there was a great deal of interaction between the Jews and the Hellenistic gentiles for hundreds of years before and after Christ. Knowing this, and knowing that Jewish authors of the 1st Century AD were often wont to use Greek instead of Hebrew for their documents, should it surprise us when the Gospels and the Epistles quote from the LXX rather than the Hebrew? Let us consider what Christ came to do, from the Gospel of Luke <span class="math inline">:</span></p>
<p><em>Doubtless you will say to me this similitude: Physician, heal thyself: as great things as we have heard done in Capharnaum, do also here in thy own country. And he said: Amen I say to you, that no prophet is accepted in his own country. In truth I say to you, there were many widows in the days of Elias in Israel, when heaven was shut up three years and six months, when there was a great famine throughout all the earth. And to none of them was Elias sent, but to Sarepta of Sidon, to a widow woman. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet: and none of them was cleansed but Naaman the Syrian.</em></p>
<p>Evidently, Christ comes to help the Gentiles to a great extent, although he comes for the Jews likewise and first and foremost. Therefore, is it much of a surprise that the Apostles and their associates would quote from the Greek Old Testament? Would we expect Gentiles to be fluent in Biblical Hebrew or would we expect them to be more able to handle the Old Testament in main language of the time, which was still read to them repeatedly after Christ’s advent? Even for Jews and proselytes, how can they hear the law and do it if they don’t understand the language? It is clear that non hebrew is possible even in the Masoretic TaNaKh, as parts of Daniel are written in the Aramaic which was spoken in Babylon and across that part of the world at that time.</p>
<h2 id="the-lxx-is-inferior-to-the-masoretic-text">"The LXX is inferior to the Masoretic Text"</h2>
<p>Some may say that the true Word of God is in the Masoretic text (henceforth MT) and that the LXX is basically inferior. This is a position taken by a lot of people, Jewish and Christian alike. They will point stuff out such as how the MT is a more consistent tradition in terms of manuscripts agreeing (The Masoretes even had a system of having an expected number of characters for each book to ensure proper copying), and that the Biblical Hebrew itself corresponds to the time period in which the works claim to be written generally speaking (Middle Egyptian loan words in the Torah etc.). Although I acknowledge that this is a good and highly reasonable tradition, I don’t think that it is the Verus Summus of the scriptures on account of this. First of all, the antiquity of the LXX is beyond reproach, and it is as much as 800 years older than the MT (which was finally finished around the 6th Century AD), and where it differs from the MT it should be given consideration on account of the occasional mistakes which pervade the copying of scribes for such a period of time. Additionally, we know from the finding of the Dead Sea Scrolls (which the reviewer at the beginning lambasted as having "sloppy" handwriting) and other documents that there are places where older Hebrew scrolls and fragments agree more with the LXX. Thirdly, we have other traditions of the scriptures, such as Latin and Syriac, which give witness to some renderings of verses which are represented by the LXX but not the MT (The most interesting one which I have found is the phrasing of the 7 and 62 weeks in Daniel 9<span class="math inline">:</span>24-27, which is phrased how I write it here in every single edition besides the MT). An important note to make is that to some extent the Latin is dependent on the LXX, but there are some questions surrounding the origins of the Syriac versions of the scriptures and if they come from another source.<br /><br />
This, of course, does not mean that I entirely dismiss the MT, however I am somewhat struggling with the primacy of place which it holds as of now (although this may be on account of ignorance). However, I do think that, based on what little I know, that any reliable Old Testament should have very serious recourse to non Hebrew traditions of the Old Testament on account of the differences in wording. This would include any Jewish publications of the TaNaKh, which seem from the outside to be exclusively renderings of the MT. When it comes to following the Law, should we not have some sort of consideration of alternative renderings of the text? Might this not shed more light on what the divine author may want us to do?</p>
<p>In any case, we see now that the Greek quotations in the New Testament should not bother us, and far from being an objection to the New Testament, actually contribute to a large corpus of materials showing the interactions with Gentile languages by Second Temple Jews. We should cast this objection to the New Testament into the fire where it belongs, as it originates in an ignorance of history.</p>
