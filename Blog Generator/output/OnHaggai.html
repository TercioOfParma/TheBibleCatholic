<h1 class="title">On Haggai 2<span class="math inline">:</span>1-9</h1>

<p>Hearing these words by the Holy Prophet Haggai inspired me to write about how this could be fulfilled by Christ and by no other means. Prophesying towards the close of the 6th Century BC with Zechariah Son of Addo, he helped to console and assist the post exhilic Jews in the reestablishment of the people on their return from that exile. Let us begin by presenting the text from the Douay Rheims Translation<span class="math inline">:</span> <em>In the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king, they began. [2] And in the seventh month, the word of the Lord came by the hand of Aggeus the prophet, saying: Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the governor of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and to the rest of the people, saying: Who is left among you, that saw this house in its first glory? and how do you see it now? is it not in comparison to that as nothing in your eyes? Yet now take courage, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord, and take courage, O Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest, and take courage, all ye people of the land, saith the Lord of hosts: and perform (for I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts) The word that I covenanted with you when you came out of the land of Egypt<span class="math inline">:</span> and my spirit shall be in the midst of you: fear not. For thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet one little while, and I will move the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land. And I will move all nations: AND THE DESIRED OF ALL NATIONS SHALL COME: and I will fill this house with glory: saith the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the Lord of hosts.</em> Additionally, let us present a Masoretic rendering, via the RSVCE translation, because there are some differences between the Masoretic and Vulgate rendering in some cases <span class="math inline">:</span> <em>In the second year of King Darius, in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Haggai, saying: Speak now to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, and say, Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How does it look to you now? Is it not in your sight as nothing? Yet now take courage, O Zerubbabel, says the Lord; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the Lord; work, for I am with you, says the Lord of hosts, according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My spirit abides among you; do not fear. For thus says the Lord of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all the nations, so that the treasure of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the Lord of hosts. The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the Lord of hosts. The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the Lord of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the Lord of hosts.</em> First of all, and I think the most important thing to note is that Haggai says "this" house. This often overlooked word often manifests something in a specific instance, rather than speaking generally. Consider, for example, that Christ says, when blessing the bread that "this" is his body. Hence we get the doctrine of transubstantiation in a basic way manifest here, or Christ’s literal presence in the bread and wine. He says "this" rock when he makes Peter the head of the church. On the other hand, Christ says he is the true vine, which would indicate that it is an image of the reality that those which are grafted to Christ have life. Thus, when Haggai says "this" house, we ought to understand this as the second temple, and not some hypothetical temple in the future. Understanding this, we have two potential ways to consider the greatness of this temple in contrast with the former. I am sure that a number of Jews would insist that this prophecy is an indication of the size of the temple. Information varies on the size of the first temple, with some counting the whole mount as being around 37 acres, and some stating the temple itself was a bit under an acre (using the numbers from 1 Kings). The Second Temple Complex was initially 17 acres, and Herod the Great expanded this to 36 acres. Now, this would seem to indicate the temples were roughly the same size after Herod, which doesn’t seem to fulfil any earthly conceptions of glory. What I am sure many of you reading are burning to point out, however, is that God repeatedly doesn’t pay a great deal of regard for physical might, for money, or such things as this. He annihilates the army of the Neo-Assyrians in 2 Kings as he does to Egypt in the original exodus. He raises up Moses, a fugitive from the Egyptians to lead his people out of Egypt. He chooses Gideon, a man who knows his own low estate, to lead the people against the Midianites in Judges. The king, whom he promises an eternal covenant to is the youngest son of a Shepard from a small settlement close to Jerusalem. A single stone from that Shepard is enough to kill Goliath, despite being decked out in all manner of armour. Thus, it seems, at least to me, that he would consider glory quantitatively. This doesn’t even to begin to touch on the fact that nothing came out of Second Temple Judaism, with one single exception, which shook all of the nations. The only people who come even close to this, besides that one, are Alexander Janneus and John Hyrcanus, whose military campaigns expanded Hasmonean territory significantly, and their forcible conversion of the Idumeans (Edomites). This didn’t glorify the temple so much as add to the territory of the Israelites. Likewise, the recleansing of the temple in the wake of Antiochus Epiphanes’ War on the Jews and his installation of pagan idols in that temple doesn’t fit this criterion either. The temple has been restored to proper use and been cleansed, but I would argue not brought to any greater glory than the former by this act. Now, who fits the pattern of the glorification of the small which God is apt to grant throughout the Old Testament, not to mention fitting another chronological prophecy which link this figure to the Second Temple Period (Daniel 9<span class="math inline">:</span>24-27)? May it be Jesus of Nazareth? This is the perspective which I take. There is nothing else which can fit this between 520BC and 70AD.</p>
