<h1 class="title">Responding to Thomas Sowell on Economy, Morality and Intentionality</h1>

<p>At the behest of my girlfriend, I began to listen again through <em>Basic Economics</em>, a text produced by the famous Economist Thomas Sowell. While this book does indeed make convincing arguments for certain positions, I have found that I am having the same issues with the view presented by its author as I did the first time.<br /><br />
First and foremost, something which I think is rather inane is Sowell’s insistance that Economics, despite being founded as a moral science, is not moral. Now, If he means a certain sentimentality which effects people, then I would agree. Of course, sentimentality isn’t a good basis for what will work and what will not, in the same way that Moral Theologian Fr Romanus Cessarino, author of <em>Introduction to Moral Theology</em> would say that one feeling their consciousness clean wouldn’t impact the morality of an action. However, as Fr Cessarino has implicitly made clear, that is not what morality actually is.<br /><br />
To get a better understanding of what morality is, let us turn to the Latin root of the term. "Moralitas" denotes the manner or character of a person, and Moralis, which is derived from the similar term Mos, refers to those things pertaining to Character and Manner. This is where we get our word Morality from. In other words, Morality is what pertains to our behaviour. Now, deliberate behaviour pertains to this as much as our sentiments, and that would also include rational judgements in human beings. Now, human behaviour is often accomplished in society with others, and this includes actions pertaining the the production, sale and regulation of goods. Thus, Sowell is wrong if he means Morality doesn’t relate to economics. He doesn’t refute the idea that Economics is morality when he says that it is just cause and effect, as if there could be anything in existence besides God himself which lacks this, and especially when we consider the effects of a poor apprehension or practice of good morals.<br /><br />
As a side note, Sowell does seem to spend a great deal of time articulating the consequences of opposing economic views in ways which struck me as very rhetorically effective likewise, so while I don’t think that such appeals are always wrong (since I know in some cases, such as when he describes the NHS, this is true), I do think it’s a bit suspect to say that economics has nothing to do with morality and then engage in such rhetoric.<br /><br />
Additionally, he spends a great deal of the first chapters lambasting good intentions. While it is of course clear that good intentions do not a good moral action make, let alone an economic one, I find it quite interesting that he himself assumes intentionality in his explanation of economic phenomena. Throughout, he notes that there is a more fitting distribution of rental properties without rent controls, which is something that I can agree with. However, this presupposes that this is an aim, and is hence intentional. While this is something I think that most people can agree with, there is a more egregious problem which I found to which this discussion forms and introduction.<br /><br />
There is a constant assumption throughout this work that the material prosperity of the people is the aim of the economy. This is something which I think is pure nonsense, and so did many other authors. Plato, for example, in Book 3 of the Republic goes as far as to say that people who have diseases of intemperance shouldn’t be treated by doctors, and this intemperance is brought on by a surfeit of food which can be consumed. Ezekiel 16 accounts among the sins of Sodom the fullness of bread, which denotes their gluttony, which from thence followed their more famous abominations. The problems that follow from this are found throughout all manner of traditions, from the aforementioned Plato, down through the Christian Tradition. This doesn’t even mention that this gluttony’s impact, either through lust or of itself, tends to warp how people perceive reality, which from there makes them more prone to mistakes.<br /><br />
If we direct our economies with efficiency in mind, without moralising in any way, shape or form, then this is what we face. Economics doesn’t exist in a vacuum. To have economic transactions be aptly controlled in a society, there must first be an understanding of what morality is as it pertains to man, as society is ultimately reliant on the actions of single people. We can even see this manifest now, where the overwhelming surplus of food, combined with man’s natural predisposition to not have self control, has lead to an obesity epidemic in the west. I don’t think I need to mention the consequences as pertains to the aforementioned lust, as I suspect everybody who reads this will notice a palpable difference between now and 1960, when economies hadn’t yet gone through the Neoliberal Coup in the 1980s, albeit being a more complicated issue than simply a surplus of food. Far from being this wild and radical improvement, in our "prosperity" people are drowning, from a huge number of people being so unable to control their passions that they cannot keep a marriage together, from the obesity caused by the abysmal food which is sold in supermarkets. If you ask me, I think a little less efficiency in some sectors of the economy may actually be needed to make the overall wellbeing of the populace better.<br /><br />
