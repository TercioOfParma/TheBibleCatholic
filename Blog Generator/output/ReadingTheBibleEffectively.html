<h1 class="title">Reading the Bible Effectively</h1>

<p>How many of you have a bible which is gathering dust? How many of you want to really get into scripture but the huge size and complexity of it is putting you off? Well, this blog will help you to do that.</p>
<h1 id="first-reading">First Reading</h1>
<p>What you want to do is to find a read the bible in a year program, and go through it slowly. I would recommend one with the catechism, so that you’ll get solid theology with it like this one <a href="https://sacredheart-semo.org/documents/2016/1/RSV-CE_Cat_chart.pdf">here</a><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. I personally use <a href="https://www.stmaryeugene.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Schedule-of-Readings-Bible-One-Year-Chronological.pdf">this</a><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>, but I regret not reading the catechism with it. If you’re reading nothing at all, go at the exact speed that the pdf recommends, and ignore the date. Start today. If you’re already in a good habit of reading, you could read two days worth in one, but you shouldn’t read the bible as a regular book. You’ll want to go through it slowly because it’s quite a complicated book.</p>
<h1 id="what-does-x-theme-mean">What does x theme mean?</h1>
<p>After this, you may want to do a thematic reading of scripture based on something you’ve noticed. Roman Catholic Liturgical readings work like this, with readings around a central theme. However, you can do this whenever you want. A useful tool for this would be a concordance. A concordance is a book which lists specific words in a version of the bible, and then provides scriptural references to show when it shows up. This way, you can come up with a theme (Say, Gold), and then compare it across the entire scriptures without memorising the scripture.</p>
<h1 id="memorising-the-scripture">Memorising the Scripture</h1>
<p>It is also a good practice to memorise the scripture, however, this is more complicated than it seems. The way you memorise the events and actions in the scripture will be different than when you want to go word by word, such as if you were to memorise the Psalms. In the latter case, praying them over and over, and reading them over and over is the most effective means. If the aim is the former kind, ideally, you would use the Method of Loci (which I may do a blog on in the future). What you would want to do is to come up with a palace for the bible, with each place referring to a book palace, and then a place in that to a chapter, and then inside of a chapter palace a thing representing the meaning of each verse. There are people online who have done this, and I would recommend checking them out.</p>
