<h1 class="title">On Developing Good Habits</h1>

<p>While it is good and such for me to write constantly about good things to do, I don’t think that it is all that useful if I don’t provide some sort of framework to actually build the habits to attain these good things. Therefore, I will dedicate a little bit of time to articulating how to build that.<br /><br />
First of all, a few numbers. Generally speaking, it takes 3 weeks to build a habit or to lose it properly. 6 weeks will be enough to really solidify a habit. Knowing this, we know how long it takes to grind a habit into you, and while there will always be effort associated with keeping a habit, this 3 week time period will be the most intense period of effort.<br /><br />
However, it is not all effort. There ought to be measures to make sure that the aim of the habit is clear. Of course, I am sure that you have all heard of SMART goals, and it is not a meme. You should really consider each of your habits in light of this, even if you have to consider a habit in perpetuity such as with something like prayer. Additionally, do not make a habit more strict than it must be, because it’s easy to fail. Finally, it’s really hard to start a habit which is very large unless you have supreme and persistent enthusiasm or life and death, which I think is very hard to initially begin with. Therefore, you ought to start small. 15 minutes a day from the start, building to an hour after 3-4 months is much much easier to keep than starting at that hour.<br /><br />
It also must be made as easy as possible to do. Therefore, first and foremost, any sort of thing which can distract you from the goal must be eliminated. Any vices, any thing that you own, or any conflicting otherwise positive habits which you are willing to sacrifice. There should be a deal of time spent considering this and then acting on it until those things are eliminated. Anything less will make it harder for you to make your habit. Additionally, try not to be too restrictive in terms of time if you want a habit to stick. Most things are not dependent on happening in the morning or evening, and therefore you should just have it down to do throughout the day.<br /><br />
Following these steps, and incorporating other things you learn by experience, you can live a life of good habits, which means that you will, day by day, come closer and attain your goals.</p>
