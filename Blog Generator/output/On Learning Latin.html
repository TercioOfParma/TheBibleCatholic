<h1 class="title">On Learning Latin</h1>
<p class="author">Elliot Lake</p>
</header>
<p>This article is going to presuppose that you want to learn Latin. There are numerous reasons for wanting to learn Latin (Great literature, the expectation of the Church etc.), but here I want to make clear what you ought to avoid and how to learn Latin initially.</p>
<h1 id="on-choosing-good-works">On choosing good works</h1>
<p>When you start, it is vital that you pick good starting materials. If you don’t, especially with a language like Latin, you’ll find yourself learning a whole lot of stuff which isn’t very useful. There is (surprisingly) an excellent basic guide of how to do this on the Language Learning Subreddit. However, I want to get into the technicalities of this here.</p>
<p>It is of an extremely high importance in Latin to nail Grammar. Unlike many modern languages, there are fewer words which make up the majority of text. Although a lot of this is because the language has been regulated to mostly educated parlance for the last millennium, I think it has a lot more to do with each word, by virtue of the grammar, playing a much wider role than similar words do in English. It is all well and good knowing about Qui/Quae/Quod, but the declensions (the changes in the word indicating role in the sentence) change the meaning a huge deal. Therefore, a book which teaches the grammar effectively is required.</p>
<p>I am going to explicitly tell you right now to avoid the Cambridge Latin Course books. I started with these and they were a horrible waste of time.</p>
<p>Many recommend Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata for this purpose, as it teaches the grammar through reading a decent amount of Latin text in the Latin itself, without English. While I think it’s somewhat effective, I personally found the stories quite boring. I doubt this will be an issue for you if, being in the initial enthusiasm stage of learning, you can power through that and systematically finish the book over the course of a few months. Alternatively, what you could do is work with a grammar translation method workbook, such as Wheelock’s Latin. While I agree this is a lot more boring than the aforementioned work, I do think that it is essential to have a book like this, or some sort of Latin Grammar book. That is because knowing all of the grammatical terminology will be very useful for subsequently developing in Latin and <strong>other languages</strong>. Having a grammatical primer like Wheelock, Collar and Daniels or even simply a grammar will give you access to the mechanics of the language directly. Although in itself it will not necessarily do all that much for you to develop fluency, the terms used in these works will help your apprehension of your own language and any other language you decide to study in future.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would say it is a must to learn from a Frequency Dictionary. Although some say that you can learn this simply through reading, having a frequency dictionary or list you can use through Anki or Memrise gives you a habit which will expose you to many of the key words found in all Latin texts without having to read them. While Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata has a vast amount of good and frequent vocabulary, it doesn’t necessarily cover these words in order of their significance in actual texts, which presumably you wish to read. Everybody should use these.</p>
<p>Finally, you need good reading material. This is it is one thing to learn what the word means, it’s another thing entirely to see it in the context of written Latin. If you use Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, this will provide your reading material. The Vatican document Veterum Sapientia recommends that beginners use Maxims and Proverbs. There are a lot of good sources for these, such as the Book of Proverbs from the Vulgate. Then, over time, you should begin looking at slightly harder, more prosaic works, such as the Latin Vulgate and Phaedrus. One good method, which I got from Olly Richards, is to read sections of these works, note the words you don’t know, and if they occur more than 5 times then you put them aside to revise them. Personally, I tend to be a bit more strict on the repeats than Olly is, but what you definitely shouldn’t be doing is just noting down all that you don’t know and learning that, because that’ll take a long time and many words are uncommon.</p>
<h1 id="properly-structuring-study">Properly structuring study</h1>
<p>Assuming that you have picked your study tools (and this is key, do not neglect this), you need to structure how you are going to study. It is key that you study all of these aspects each day, but please don’t attempt to understand everything at the expense of spending too much time getting angry. It is a lot better than you spend maybe 15 minutes studying grammar each day, and then revisit the next day to reattempt understanding of a difficult aspect than to spend an hour fuming over it in difficulty. Additionally, it’s frustrating how little I see habit building mentioned in Language Learning circles. There is all of this emphasis on studying every day, and little mention of either building this up careful and keeping it within manageable bounds. First of all, don’t attempt to start a habit with 1 hour a day unless you know you have overwhelming enthusiasm. Start with 15 minutes of Grammar or reading Lingua Latina Per Se Illustrata, and then keep going until it’s a serious habit (I.E. 3-6 weeks). If you don’t you’ll fall flat on your face after 2-3 weeks when something comes along and destroys the habit you’re building. Additionally, try to spread the study throughout the day, so you’re doing 15 minutes here and 15 minutes there. That way, you will be less likely to get bored. After you’ve been studying for a long time, then worry about serious time expenditure. Also try to study things which you find interesting to need. If you are somebody into Ecclesiastical matters, this is incredibly easy once you reach a certain level of fluency, because you can simply open up the Latin versions of Encyclicals and read them section by section.</p>
<h1 id="work-to-be-done-in-latin">Work to be done in Latin</h1>
<p>Presuming that you’re now of a decent fluency of Latin, there is a lot of work to be done with it. A huge portion of medieval and renaissance literature lays untranslated, not to mention much of the hundreds of volumes of theology in the Patrologia Latina. To aid historians and the church, it is paramount that these works are translated into languages that the professionals operating in these fields can understand. Therefore, you could use this skill to go and work on this colossal task. Besides this you could also use it to simply enjoy already translated works in their original forms, as translations tend to lose much of the sense of an original work.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Latin is a profoundly important language that is non trivial and requires real legwork to develop an understanding in. However, with consistent habits, you can reach a fluency in it and become able to truly help our world come to greater terms with the alien and much more interesting world of our past, not to mention be able to communicate with a larger amount of people through the auxiliary assistance of this language in apprehending others.</p>
