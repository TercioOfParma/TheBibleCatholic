# Introduction

Through the prayers of our holy Fathers, O Lord Jesus Christ our God,
have mercy on us. Amen. Glory to Thee, our God, glory to Thee. O
Heavenly King, Comforter, Spirit of Truth, Who art everywhere present
and fillest all things, Treasury of good things and Giver of life: Come
and dwell in us, and cleanse us of all impurity, and save our souls, O
Good One. Holy God, Holy Mighty, Holy Immortal, have mercy on us. **3x**
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in
the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. O Most
Holy Trinity, have mercy on us. O Lord, blot out our sins. O Master,
pardon our iniquities. O Holy One, visit and heal our infirmities for
Thy name's sake. Lord have mercy. **3x** Glory to the Father and to the
Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now and ever
shall be, world without end. Amen. Our Father, Who art in Heaven,
hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done, on earth as it
is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our
trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not
into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. Amen O Lord, Jesus
Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us. Amen. Lord, Have mercy. **12x**
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in
the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. O
come, let us worship God our King. O come, let us worship and fall down
before Christ our King and God. O come, let us worship and fall down
before Christ Himself, our King and God.

# Psalm 50

Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy great mercy. And according to
the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my iniquity. Wash me yet
more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my
iniquity, and my sin is always before me. To thee only have I sinned,
and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy
words and mayst overcome when thou art judged. For behold I was
conceived in iniquities; and in sins did my mother conceive me. For
behold thou hast loved truth$:$ the uncertain and hidden things of thy
wisdom thou hast made manifest to me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with
hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made
whiter than snow. To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness: and
the bones that have been humbled shall rejoice. Turn away thy face from
my sins, and blot out all my iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, O
God: and renew a right spirit within my bowels. Cast me not away from
thy face; and take not thy holy spirit from me. Restore unto me the joy
of thy salvation, and strengthen me with a perfect spirit. I will teach
the unjust thy ways: and the wicked shall be converted to thee. Deliver
me from blood, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall
extol thy justice. O Lord, thou wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall
declare thy praise. For if thou hadst desired sacrifice, I would indeed
have given it: with burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted. A
sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, O
God, thou wilt not despise. Deal favourably, O Lord, in thy good will
with Sion; that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up. Then shalt thou
accept the sacrifice of justice, oblations and whole burnt offerings:
then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.

# Creed

I believe in one God, the Father almighty, maker of heaven and earth, of
all things visible and invisible. I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
the Only Begotten Son of God, born of the Father before all ages. God
from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, begotten, not made,
consubstantial with the Father; through him all things were made. For us
men and for our salvation he came down from heaven, and by the Holy
Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and became man. For our sake he
was crucified under Pontius Pilate, he suffered death and was buried,
and rose again on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He
ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He
will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead and his
kingdom will have no end. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the
giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the Son, who with the
Father and the Son is adored and glorified, who has spoken through the
prophets. I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church. I
confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins and I look forward to
the resurrection of the dead and the life of the world to come. Amen.

# Jesus Prayer

Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. **100x**

# Dismissal

It is truly meet to bless thee, the Theotokos, ever blessed and most
blameless, and Mother of our God. More honorable than the Cherubim, and
beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim, who without corruption
gavest birth to God the Word, the very Theotokos, thee do we magnify.
Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in
the beginning, is now and ever shall be, world without end. Amen. Lord,
have mercy. **3x** O Lord, Bless. O Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, for
the sake of the prayers of Thy most pure Mother, of our holy and
God-bearing fathers, and all the saints, have mercy on us and save us,
for Thou art good and the Lover of mankind. Amen.
