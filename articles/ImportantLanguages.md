title: Important Languages to Know
---

When reading through either Church works or even just general literacy,
chances are you will have to know languages beyond English to get a full
picture. Since a lot of things have occurred which have not been
translated, and since sometimes the English sources are insufficient, it
becomes necessary to learn other languages, particularly concerning
affairs of the church. In this case, first and foremost one **must**
know Latin. Although Sacred Scriptures were originally in Koine Greek or
in Hebrew, the primary language of theological discourse in the True
Church and in the west is Latin. Although works by the likes of St
Aquinas and St Augustine are available in English, the grammar of Latin
makes it such that often a lot of the nuance of a text is lost in
translation. Therefore, if you take away nothing else from this post,
please learn Latin. Subsequent to that, in these same matters, French,
Italian and German are key. This is because these, besides English, are
the predominant languages of Ecclesiastical and Political discourse, and
have been for at least 300 years. For Catholic Theology, French is
particularly important, as the Fathers Sertillanges, Garrigou-Lagrange,
and also the layman Jacques Maritain all wrote in this language.
Likewise, the likes of Joseph Ratzinger (Benedict the XVI) and others
wrote in German. Finally, Italian is that which a great number of modern
church documents are written in, and while I am told that Google
Translate gets the true sense of these, I am hesitant to trust such
things. Then, the other scriptural and patristic languages, Biblical
Hebrew, Koine Greek and Syriac ought to be learnt. This will help in the
grasping of those final areas of the tradition which, while exterior to
Latin Tradition, are indeed relied upon greatly by it and are also great
traditions in their own right. Finally, subsequent to this, languages
for evangelisation should be considered. Although this could be local
languages of those being evangelised to, I think that the scriptural and
sacred languages of other faiths ought to be learnt as well. Classical
and Medieval Arabic, as well as the various dialects of Hebrew down the
centuries, and maybe even Sanskrit should be considered. In any case, we
could spend many many years learning all of these languages. However,
this should always be considered from the point of view of practicality.
The church herself, in Veterum Sapientia made it incredibly clear that
Latin has a prominent position within the Church. Besides this, which is
a must, I think that the rest can be learnt in accordance with personal
judgement of utility.
